By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, better known simply as Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), is a novel by Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and a parody of the \"travellers' tales\" literary sub-genre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. The book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.\" [1] Since then, it has never been out of print. Cavehill in Belfast is thought to be the inspiration for the novel. Swift imagined that the mountain resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city. [2]",

Students will be able to create iOS apps that adhere to standard practices, including the use of stock UI elements, layout techniques, and common navigation interfaces. They’ll explore app design by brainstorming, planning, prototyping, and evaluating an app idea of their own. Three guided app projects help students build an app in Xcode from the ground up with step-by-step instructions. Xcode playgrounds help students learn key programming concepts as they write Swift code in an interactive coding environment that lets them experiment with code and see the results immediately.",

Using the techniques needed on the race track, one can successfully navigate all of life's ordeals.<br /><br />On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through: the sacrifices Denny has made to succeed professionally; the unexpected loss of Eve, Denny's wife; the three-year battle over their daughter, Zoë, whose maternal grandparents pulled every string to gain custody. In the end, despite what he sees as his own limitations, Enzo comes through heroically to preserve the Swift family, holding in his heart the dream that Denny will become a racing champion with Zoë at his side. Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, the wise canine can barely wait until his next lifetime, when he is sure he will return as a man. <br /><br />A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, The Art of Racing in the Rain is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life . . . as only a dog could tell it.",

            "description": "This Teacher Guide provides tools to deepen engagement with aspiring app developers, whether you have experience teaching with Swift or other programming languages.&#xa0;<br />\nThe Develop in Swift Explorations course is designed to help students learn key computing concepts and build a solid foundation in programming with Swift. They’ll learn about the impact of computing and apps on society, economies, and cultures while exploring iOS app development. Lessons take students through the app design process: brainstorming, planning, prototyping, and evaluating an app of their own. While they may still be developing skills to convert prototypes into full apps, designing an app helps students grow into the exciting world of app development.<br /><br />\nOptional units provide students an engaging way to explore advanced technology concepts and the impact of computing on their lives. An illustrated, fictional story follows a group of students in a film club and their use of technology to arrange a viewing party, order food, and post to social media. Interactive illustrations provide insight into the technology behind their activities—including topics such as how computers digitize images and how online activity can be stored and tracked."

By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships, better known simply as Gulliver's Travels (1726, amended 1735), is a novel by Anglo-Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, that is both a satire on human nature and a parody of the \"travellers' tales\" literary sub-genre. It is Swift's best known full-length work, and a classic of English literature. The book became popular as soon as it was published. John Gay wrote in a 1726 letter to Swift that \"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.\"[1] Since then, it has never been out of print.",

Her exasperated father has informed her that if she can’t find a husband by the end of her third London season, she will be forced to marry a man she hates—the ruthless entrepreneur Matthew Swift.<br /><br />Daisy is horrified. A Bowman never admits defeat, so she decides to do whatever it takes to marry someone . . . anyone . . . other than Matthew. What she doesn’t count on, however, is Matthew’s unexpected charm, or the blazing sensuality that soon flares beyond both their control. And Daisy discovers that the man she has always hated just might turn out to be the man of her dreams.<br /><br />But when a scandalous secret is uncovered, it could destroy both Matthew and a love more passionate and irresistible than Daisy’s wildest fantasies.",

Students expand on the knowledge and skills they developed in Fundamentals by extending their work in iOS app development, creating more complex and capable apps. They’ll work with data from a server and explore new iOS APIs that allow for much richer app experiences—including displaying large collections of data in multiple formats. They’ll explore app design by brainstorming, planning, prototyping, and evaluating an app idea of their own. Three guided app projects help students build an app in Xcode from the ground up with step-by-step instructions. Xcode playgrounds help students learn key programming concepts as they write Swift code in an interactive coding environment that lets them experiment with code and see the results immediately."

            "description": "A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People From Being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick, commonly referred to as A Modest Proposal, is a Juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by Jonathan Swift in 1729. Swift suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical hyperbole mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as Irish policy in general.",

The problem? Well, it's hard to count just one. He stumbles into the snow, falls down, and can't seem to get himself back up again. Imagine the indignity of dying in a snowbank? But when a little Christmas angel comes and rescues him, he can't resist stealing a kiss. She looks heaven sent and tastes like the sweetest gingerbread. It all seems innocent enough until the next morning when he realizes she was no angel but an eligible lady and one who might just request marriage as a boon. How does a duke get out of such a situation? He lies about his identity, of course. Which means his troubles are only just beginning.<br /><br />A lady in need of a Christmastide miracle…<br /><br />Lady Noelle hasn't slept properly in months. Which is exactly why she is awake when an unknown gentleman falls into the snow. When he doesn't rise, she dashes to his rescue, forgetting all about the wish she'd just been making on a Christmas star. A request to help her sisters overcome the loss of their mother. But once she reaches the gentleman, several things become apparent. He's young, handsome, well dressed, and possibly, her wish come true…<br /><br />Now, if he'd just cooperate.",

As sixteen-year-old Jonathan Swift carefully slides through dry brush in the dark, he hopes to bag some game to help feed his family. As a branch cracks nearby, Jonathan suddenly realizes he is not alone. Moments later, he manages to shed his pursuer and arrives home, shaken. His escape is temporary, however, and events will soon take a turn that changes the direction of Jonathan's life forever.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFrustrated when they cannot catch him in the act of poaching, the squire's men ambush Jonathan and leave him for dead on a Royal Navy ship. Although he has never been on a ship before, Swift finds he is a new member of HMS Winchester's company. Unaccustomed to disciplined shipboard life and without friends, family, or security, he soon realizes that he must persevere or die.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tIn this historical tale, a young man pressed into the navy discovers that his destiny is more dangerous than he ever imagined when he finds himself in the midst of an attack on the most formidable fort in North America."

For almost all of those years she has been the clandestine lover to Paul Sheringham, young heir of a neighboring house. The two now meet on an unseasonably warm March day—Mothering Sunday—a day that will change Jane’s life forever. <br /> &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; <br />As the narrative moves back and forth from 1924 to the end of the century, what we know and understand about Jane—about the way she loves, thinks, feels, sees, remembers—expands with every vividly captured moment. Her story is one of profound self-discovery, and through her, Graham Swift has created an emotionally soaring, deeply affecting work of fiction.",

Jefferson Parker, Roland Ford is hunting down a mysterious killer, jockeying for position with the FBI, and risking everything to save a friend in terrible jeopardy.</b><br /><br />Returning hero and private investigator Roland Ford is on the trail of a mysterious killer who is beheading CIA drone operators and leaving puzzling clues at each crime scene. His troubled friend Lindsay Rakes is afraid for her own life and the life of her son after a fellow flight crew member is killed in brutal fashion. Even more terrifying is the odd note the killer left behind: \"Welcome to Caliphornia. This is not the last.\" Ford strikes an uneasy alliance with San Diego-based FBI agent Joan Taucher, who is tough as nails but haunted by what she sees as the Bureau's failure to catch the 9/11 terrorists, many of whom spent their last days in her city. As the killer strikes again, Ford and Taucher dash into the fray, each desperate for their own reasons--each ready to risk it all to stop the killer from doing far more damage.",
